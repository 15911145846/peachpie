## What is Peachpie?
Peachpie is a modern PHP compiler based on Roslyn by Microsoft and drawing from our popular Phalanger project. It allows PHP to be executed within the .NET framework, thereby opening the door for PHP developers into the world of .NET – and vice versa.

The goal of the project is to compile legacy PHP code into portable class libraries, which enables developers to build cross-platform apps and libraries for Microsoft platforms quickly and easily. As a direct result, PHP applications powered by Peachpie would run across all devices and operating systems that are able to run .NET.

Besides granting PHP programmers access to cross-platform development, Peachpie allows for a full compatibility with .NET, which enables the development of hybrid applications, where part of the code is written in C# and part in PHP. The parts will be entirely compatible and can communicate seamlessly, all within the .NET framework.

Peachpie makes use of Microsoft's Roslyn compiler and years worth of developing Phalanger, where the design for this compiler was established and valuable experience was obtained in the process. This, together with an extensive type analysis, allows us to set the objective of Peachpie to be a significant performance increase of PHP applications and components. 

## How to build or execute?
This project is a work in progress. Please be aware that Peachpie is not complete and is therefore not intended to be downloaded and executed at this point, but you are welcome to use it for your inspiration. You can execute Peachpie via the command line. Please refer to our [short introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVWVInYiYLY) to see how to run the compiler or our [Getting Started](https://github.com/iolevel/peachpie/wiki/Getting-Started) section.
